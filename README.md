# Company Templates Â· Simple Management of Company Templates in SharePoint Online

## Summary

Useful scenario to make centrally managed company templates (from a document library in SharePoint Online) available in every document library within the whole SharePoint tenant. 
![Demo](./assets/Demo.gif)

A SharePoint administrator can easily configure the document library that contains all templates in the settings view:
![Admin Settings](./assets/Settings.jpg)

> [!WARNING]
> ðŸ‘‰ For now, company templates can only be stored in one single library (aka Â«template repostoryÂ») within the whole SPO tenant. Therefore, only a user that has `isSiteAdmin` property assigned can access the settings view. We strongly recommend that only a tenant admin should / can configure the template repository settings.

> [!NOTE]
> By defining the template repository, the settings will be stored in a **tenant property** (property name `easyTemplatesSettings`). Every instance of this extension refers to this tenant property. 

## Features

Under the hood, the extension is built on React and PnPjs and touches on the following topics:
* **SharePoint Tenant Properties** to store the settings tenant-wide
* **React Providers** for a centralized state management of the templates and the actions
* **React Hooks** to access several states and to load data asynchronously within different React Components

From a user perspective, the extension covers these features:

- [x] Show an additional button 'Company templates' (when the actual user is authorized to add files to the library)
- [x] List files that serve as company templates in a tree structure
- [x] Filter by file category
- [x] Filter by name
- [x] Copy selected files fom template repository to the current document library
- [x] Show a settings page to all users who have permissions to manage lists

It uses several ["Reusable React controls"](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-controls-react/) for an awesome user experience.

### Upcoming Features (or not yet implemented ideas)

- [ ] Show link(s) to copied file(s) to be opened in a new browser tab (Dan's feature request ðŸ˜ƒ)
- [ ] Display additional metadata (filesize, current version) of the template file
- [ ] Show a preview of a selected template file by clicking on its file name
- [ ] Refresh template list by clicking on a refresh button in the command bar
